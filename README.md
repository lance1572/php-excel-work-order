# PHP Work Load Order

## This is a work in progress. I would not use this in production.

This is a PHP form for uploading excel docs. It does a quick check of the excel fields before the user can upload. It will give the user feedback for the excel as well as feedback for the form itself.

It uses PHPOffice

## To do
- Send email notifications. Most like it will use sendmail
- Refactor some of the form code
